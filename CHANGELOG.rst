Unreleased
----------
**Added**
  ``MappingSource`` a new class, that given a data source and a dictionary of
  columns to callables, maps the callables over each element of the specified
  column before returning the row.

**Changed**
  ``SlowlyChangingDimension`` improved to make ``versionatt`` optional. 
  (GitHub issue #12. Thanks to HereticSK) 

**Fixed**
  ``ConnectionWrapper.execute`` does not pass the argument ``arguments`` to
  the underlying cursor's execute method if ``arguments`` is None. Some drivers
  raise an Error if None is passed, some don't.


Version 2.5
-----------
**Added**
  ``TypedCSVSource`` a new class that reads a CSV file (by means of
  csv.DictReader) and performs user-specified casts (or other function calls)
  on the values before returning the rows.

  Added ``definequote`` function to enable quoting of SQL identifiers in all
  tables.

  Added ``getdbfriendlystr`` function to enable conversion of values into
  strings that are accepted by a DBMS. Boolean values become '0' or '1', None
  values can be replaced by another value.

  All Bulkloadables now accept the argument ``strconverter`` to their __init__
  methods. This should be a function that converts values into strings that
  are written to a temporary file and eventually bulkloaded. The default value
  is the new ``getdbfriendlystr``.

  ``SlowlyChangingDimension`` can now optionally be given the argument
  ``useorderby``  when instantiated. If True (the default), the
  SQL used by ``lookup`` uses ORDER  BY (this is the same behaviour
  as before). If False, ORDER BY is not used and the SQL used by ``lookup``
  will fetch all versions of the member and then find the key value for the
  newest version with Python code. For some systems, this can lead to
  significant performance improvements.

**Changed**
  Generator used in ConnectionWrapper.fetchalltuples to reduce memory
  consumption. (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko)

  ``SlowlyChangingDimension`` can sometimes avoid deleting from the cache on
  updates, now checked in the same way as in ``CachedDimension``

  rowfactory now tries to use fetchmany. (Suggested by Alexey Kuzmenko).

  ``_BaseBulkloadable`` now has the method ``insert`` while the methods
  ``_insertwithnull`` and ``_insertwithoutnull`` have been removed (and
  subclasses do thus not pick one of them at runtime). The ``insert`` method
  will always call ``strconverter`` (see above) no matter if a ``nullsubst``
  has been specified or not.

  ``_BaseBulkloadable`` will now raise a TypeError if no ``nullsubst`` is
  specified and a None value is present. Before this change, the None value
  would silently be converted into the string 'None'. Users must now
  give a ``nullsubst`` argument when instantiating a subclass of
  ``_BaseBulkloadable`` that should be able to handle None values.

  ``SubprocessFactTable`` has been changed similarly to ``_BaseBulkloadable``
  and does now define ``insert`` which uses ``strconverter``. Thus
  ``_insertwithnull`` and  ``_insertwithoutnull`` have been removed.

  getunderlyingmodule has been changed and now tries different possible module
  names and looks for 'paramstyle' and 'connect'. ConnectionWrapper now uses
  getunderlying module in __init__ when trying to determine the paramstyle to
  use. 

**Fixed**
  Using ``cachesize=0`` with ``SlowlyChangingDimension`` no longer causes
  crash.

  Problem with double use of namemappings in _before_update in CachedDimension
  and SlowlyChangingDimension fixed. (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko).

  Problem with rowfactory only returning one row fixed. 
  (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko).

  Problem with JDBCConnectionWrapper.rowfactory returning dicts with incorrect
  keys fixed. (GitHub issue #5).

  Problem with ``TypeOneSlowlyChangingDimension`` caching None after an update
  if a namemapping mapped to an attribute not in the update row fixed.

  Problem in __init__.copy fixed.

  Namemapping now used when comparing measure values in FactTable.ensure
  with compare=True.

Version 2.4
-----------
**Note**
  This is the last version to support versions of Python 2 older than 2.7

**Added**
  ``TypeOneSlowlyChangingDimension`` a new class that adds support for
  efficient loading and updating of a type 1 exclusive slowly changing
  dimension.

  ``CachedBulkLoadingDimension`` a new class that supports bulk loading a
  dimension without requiring the caching of all rows that are loaded.

  Alternative implementation of ``FIFODict`` based on an ``OrderedDict``.
  (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko).

  Dimension classes with finite caches can now be prefilled more efficiently
  using the "FETCH FIRST" SQL statement for increased performance.

  Examples on how to perform bulk loading in MySQL, Oracle Database, and
  Microsoft SQL Server. (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko).

**Changed**
  It is now verified that ``lookupatts`` is a subset of all attributes.

  All method calls to a superclass constructor now uses named parameters.

  Made cosmetic changes, and added additional information about how to ensure
  cache coherency between pygrametl and the database to existing docstrings.

  The entire codebase was updated to adhere more closely to PEP8 using
  autopep8.

**Fixed**
  Using ``dependson`` no longer causes crashes due to multiple loads of a
  table. (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko).

  Using ``defaultidvalue`` no longer causes ``Dimension.ensure`` to fail to
  insert correctly, or make ``CachedDimension.ensure`` produce duplicates.
  (Thanks to Alexey Kuzmenko).

  Using ``SlowlyChangingDimension`` with the cache disabled no longer causes a
  crash in ``SlowlyChangingDimension.scdensure``.

  Using ``BulkDimension``, ``CachedBulkDimension`` or ``BulkFactTable`` with
  ``tempdest`` and ``usefilename`` no longer causes a crash in
  ``_BaseBulkloadable._bulkloadnow``.

Version 2.3.2
-------------
**Fixed**
  ``SnowflakedDimension`` no longer crashes due to ``levellist`` not being a
  list before the length of it is computed.

  ``FactTable`` now inserts the correct number of commas to the SQL statements
  used for inserting rows, independent of the value of ``keyrefs``.

Version 2.3.1
-------------
**Fixed**
  Using other parameter styles than ``pyformat`` no longer causes a crash in
  ``ConnectionWrapper``.

Version 2.3
-------------
**Added**
  A new quick start guide was added to the documentation.

  Added code examples for all classes in pygrametl except ``Steps``.

  pygrametl now officially supports Python 2.6.X, Python 2.7.X, Python 3,
  Jython 2.5.X and Jython 2.7.X.
  
  ``BulkDimension`` a new class that supports bulk loading of dimension tables.
  
  ``_BaseBulkloadable`` with common functionality for ``BulkFactTable`` and
  ``BulkDimension``.

  ``SQLSource`` can now pass parameters to the cursor's ``execute`` function.

**Fixed**
  Importing everything from ``tables`` using a wildcard now longer causes a
  crash.

Version 2.2
-----------
**Added**
  Created a PyPI package and uploaded it to pypi.python.org.

  Added code examples for some of the classes in pygrametl.

**Changed**
  Documentation is now written in reStructuredText and compiled using Sphinx.
